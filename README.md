# Weather-Dashboard
The purpose of this project was to create an weather application using the API "Open Weather Map". In this respository you will see a index.html, style.css, moment.js,and script.js. The requirements of the project was to create an weather application where you search a city and the first card body of the website will display, the image of the weather, city, temperature, wind-speed, and uv-index. To aquire these details, I had to call the ajax three times. One for the current weather. One for the forecast. And one for the UV-index. And in the bottom of the website, you will see 5 cards that display the weather for the next 5 days for that city.
