# Weather-Dashboard-Homework
The purpose of this project was to create an weather application using the API "Open Weather Map". In this respository you will see a index.html, style.css, moment.js,and script.js. The requirements of the project was to create an weather application where you search a city and the first card body of the website will display, the image of the weather, city, temperature, wind-speed, and uv-index. To aquire these details, I had to call the ajax three times. One for the current weather. One for the forecast. And one for the UV-index. And in the bottom of the website, you will see 5 cards that display the weather for the next 5 days for that city. 
  The code is not done yet on my part. I hav eth ecurrent weather and forecast working being displayed in the website. But the problem that I am having is that the icon for the forecast is not showing up in the display. I tried to call ajax to retrieve the uv-index, but for some reason it is not showing up. In addition to this project, we also had to use local storage of the last searched city we had and display it in the left hand corner of the screen. In my code, my storage it seems that it is coming out as null and the city is getting repeated on the left-hand-side of the screen. There is much more work that needs to be done for the assignment. Please feel free to give me any feedback on it.
